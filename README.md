# React Molecule

Molecule is a super light-weight framework that lets you reason about inter-component communication iterating on FLUX paradigms and introducing a new kind of glue between your components.

Whether you're writing something simple, either you're writing a complex plugin, you will spend time thinking on the following:

- Inter-component communication
- Component Customisability
- Isolation
- Extensability
- Hackability

## Install

`npm i -S react-molecule`

## [Documentation](./docs/index.md)

Learn about using React Molecule in an easy and intuitive manner. The documentation provides the learning curve for you to get up to speed and start hacking!

```jsx
const UserPage = props => (
  <Molecule>
    <SearchBar />
    <UserList />
  </Molecule>
);
```

## API

Work in progress. We aim to create a propper documentation.
